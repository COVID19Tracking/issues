# The COVID Tracking Project Code of Conduct

## Purpose
The COVID Tracking Project is committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free environment for participants of all races, gender and trans statuses, sexual orientations, physical abilities, physical appearances, and beliefs. We’ve written this code of conduct not because we expect bad behavior from our community—which, in our experience, is overwhelmingly kind and civil—but because we believe a clear code of conduct is a necessary part of building a respectful community space.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations and norms for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in the COVID Tracking Project to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Community norms
We ask all community members to model and encourage the following behaviors:

* **Be considerate in communication and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.** Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. We have members from many fields and communities with highly varied norms, and one of the things we’re proudest of in our project so far is that everyone is showing up with active kindness and respect.

* **Attempt collaboration before conflict.** Projects with very loose hierarchies can produce stressful situations in which it’s not immediately clear how to proceed, or who can make a final decision. It’s fine to put a pin in a discussion and ask for help from a workstream lead if you get stuck. Everyone here is working hard to do something important in a very weird situation, and the more kindness we show each other in our (inevitable, often highly fruitful) disagreements, the stronger our community and work will be.

* **Take care of each other.** Alert project leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential. And most importantly, if you notice that a peer is having a rough time and it doesn’t feel like an encouraging-emoji situation, please call on project leadership—we will do our best to connect that person with resources and support in every way that we can. 

## Unacceptable behavior

Discrimination and harassment are expressly prohibited in our community. Harassment may include, but is not limited to, intimidation; stalking; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; intentional or repeated misgendering; sexist, racist, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory or derogatory language; and unwelcome sexual attention.

In order to provide such an environment, we commit to being considerate in our language use. Any behavior or language which is unwelcoming—whether or not it rises to the level of harassment—is also strongly discouraged.

Much exclusionary behavior takes the form of microaggressions—subtle put-downs which may be unconsciously delivered. Regardless of intent, microaggressions can have a significant negative impact on the people who receive them and have no place in our community.

The same goes for tone policing, or responding negatively to the emotion behind a person’s message while ignoring its content (telling someone who is discussing an issue that makes them upset to “calm down” instead of responding to their concerns is an example of tone policing).

There are a host of behaviors and language common on technical projects which are worth noting as specifically unwelcome: Avoid “well, actuallys”—pedantic corrections that are often insulting and unproductive; never respond with surprise when someone asks for help; and take care neither to patronize others nor assume complete knowledge of a topic. This last point is especially important: Many women and people of color in our industries have many tales of being either condescended to about a field in which they are experts, or else excluded from learning opportunities because a colleague wouldn’t make an effort to answer questions—don’t be that person. Remember that your community members may have expertise you are unaware of, and listen at least as much as you speak.

Don’t be a jerk in any of these specific ways, but also just be good to each other.

## Consequences of unacceptable behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including workstream leads, founders, and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, project leadership may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including removal from the community without warning.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please tell one of the following project or safety leads as soon as possible. You can direct message one or all of us in Slack or find additional contact options in our profiles:

* Alexis Madrigal
* Erin Kissane
* JD Maresco
* Amanda French

## Scope
We expect all community members to abide by this Code of Conduct in all project spaces–Slack, Github, social channels, etc—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to project business.

This Code of Conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
